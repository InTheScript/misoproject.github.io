        Dataset makes managing client-side datasets easy. It handles loading, parsing, sorting, querying &amp; manipulating data from anything from a CSV to a Google Spreadsheet painless, including realtime data sources.

        Dataset is designed to solve common problems and patterns around client-side dataset traversal, manipulation and management.
      %p
        Unlike more general client-side model frameworks dataset is designed exclusively for working with matricies/tables of data. This allows dataset to provide a rich set of capabilities with this specific use case in mind & optimise for large numbers of rows.
      %p
        In addition to helping load and parse data Dataset makes it easy to query and select subsets of data, creating &quot;views&quot; that automatically update when the underlying data changes. By binding to events, it's trivial to create interfaces to realtime or user-manipulated data. Dataset provides some basic computations such as min and max and derivatives such as groupings and moving averages.
      %p
        Dataset was created in a way that allows a high degree of extension. We are looking forward to expanding our array of importers, parsers and computational methods.
