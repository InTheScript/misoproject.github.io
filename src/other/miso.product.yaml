    A <code>Miso.Product</code> is what you will be returned if you run a method such as 
    <code>max</code> on a dataset that has <code>sync</code> set to true. The product object
    allows you to bind events to it, meaning you can automatically update anything using the
    product when the underlying dataset changes in a way which affects the current value of
    the product.
