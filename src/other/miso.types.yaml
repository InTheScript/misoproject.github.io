description: |
  Miso types are used to set and manage the data types on columns. These sets of
  functions handle testing what type data is and coercing it into the correct format
  for a given type. The type system is completely extensible, making it easy to create
  rich custom types for your data when it would be helpful to do so. All types
  must have the following interface.
  = toDisplayCodeBlock("dataset/types/customTypeSignature")
  
methods:
-
  name: typeof
  signature: Miso.Dataset.typeOf( value, options )
  returns: String
